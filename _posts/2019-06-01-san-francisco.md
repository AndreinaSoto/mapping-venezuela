Type: Cathedral

Region: Western

Foundation: 1583 (approximate date). Another possible date for construction is 1656.

The cathedral is located in the city of	Cumaná, which was founded circa	1520 by Franciscans and Dominicans. Their convent was already in existence around that time 1520. In October 1520, indians from the cCumanagoto culture destroyed the Franciscan mission. Later on, Dominicans tried to also settle in the region without much success.

The town was founded again in 1523 as Nueva Córdoba by Jácome Castellón, with the assistance of forty married Spaniards (whose names are listed by Gasparini on pp. 28-29). By 1657, the town still had a small population and a slow growth due to the constant attacks of Cumanagotos and Caribes:

*"Tanta era la opresión de los españoles que por ninguna parte se atrevían a salir de sus haciendas, y lo hacían eran con grandísimo riesgos; de ordinario sucedían muertes de españoles y de esclavos que flechaban los indions"* (Francisco de Tauste, capuchino, 1680).

The region was managed by *encomenderos*. In 1658, six capuchin missionaries arrive to Cumaná with the order to *reducir* the indians, which helped in the settlement of the Spaniards and the consolidation of the *encomiendas.*

The temple is no longer active is now in ruins.
