I am a History PhD student at **UCSB**. My research examines forms of religiosity among people of African descent in early-modern Venezuela. I am particularly interested in how these forms of religiosity expressed in local concerns about death and funerary practices.  

As part of [Neogranadina](https://www.neogranadina.org/), I work as research assistant in the development of a digital collection of archival materials about the New Kingdom Granada, I also handle the supervision of the volunteers who help us in the processing of the digitized volumes.

I created this website to share some of my work in history and the digital humanities. On my blog you can also read some of my reflections about the themes I am passionate about.
