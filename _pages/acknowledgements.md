While I have produced all the digital content, most of the historical information used for the datasets, maps, and entries in my Sacred Spaces database comes from **Graziano Gasparini's** book *Templos Coloniales de Venezuela*, and the **Institutional Assets and Monuments of Venezuela** (IAM). Additional sources have been stated for each of the entries.

Their works have made possible to keep track of the cultural heritage of Venezuela. To all of you, thank you!

Special thanks to **Prof. Juan Cobo Betancourt** for providing assistance in the design of the website!
