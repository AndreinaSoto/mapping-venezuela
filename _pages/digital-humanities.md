# The Religious Landscape of Early-Modern Venezuela 

The Religious Landscape of Early-Modern Venezuela is a project that aims at visualizing the making of the Province of Venezuela through the lens of Catholic institutions. Missionaries, religious orders, the secular church, and  *encomenderos* were actively involved in the early process of colonization of the region, changing the landscape and seeking to alter the settlement patterns of the indigenous societies according to European models. Mapping and registering this process can help us understand better how colonization worked on the ground, how civic and religious communities engaged in the quest to create towns, villages, and settlements, and how this new landscape came hand-in-hand with the attempts to impose, physically and spiritually, Catholic practices.
