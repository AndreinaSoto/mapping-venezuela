      <p><strong>Mapping Early-Modern</strong> Venezuela is a digital project about the history of the Province of Venezuela through the lens of the religious built environment during the early modern period (1500-1800).</p>

<p>During the European expansion in the Americas, religious actors enacted policies on the ground that set the basis for the territorial organizations of the province and the practice of Catholicism. Missionaries, religious orders, and the secular church were also actively involved in the evangelization of the indigenous and African population, which required to change the landscape and redefine the space based on Catholic and European patterns. This was not possible without creating settlements and religious temples, which were ever present in the layouts of the colonial towns and cities.<a href="#section1">[1]</a></p>

<p>The region known today as Venezuela was the product of these European impositions which sought to unify the region into administrative, military, and religious boundaries.</p>

<p>Even though Catholic institutions in the Province of Venezuela started with a limited presence, by the seventeenth century their efforts increased in solidifying the extension of Dioceses across the region, accomplishing the <em>reducción</em> of the indigenous population through mission and encomiendas, and the establishment of churches and chapels in towns.<a href="#section2">[2]</a>  Africans and people of African descent were forced to convert to Catholicism with the intention of “impose the religious values of Europe and destroy their pagan beliefs and superstitions.”<a href="#section3">[3]</a>  Masters and local authorities were legally obligated to supervise the indoctrination of the slaves into Catholicism and their sacraments, and allow their presence and participation in religious rituals. Blacks, <em>zambos</em>, mulattoes, and free blacks started building “<em>ranchos</em> and <em>conucos</em> in nearby areas to the production of cocoa and where the mayordomos used to gather to attend the religious acts that, permanently or sporadically, were presided by the Catholic priests.”<a href="#section4">[4]</a> All this activity increased the establishments of town across the region most of them expanding and surviving until today.  Mapping and registering this process can help us understand better how colonization worked on the ground and the strategic role of the Catholic church in this process of imperial expansion. It also reflects how civic and religious communities engaged in the quest to create towns, villages, and settlements, a new landscape that came hand-in-hand with the attempts to impose, physically and spiritually, Catholic practices.</p>

<p>This project presents different elements to learn more about this process in Venezuela.</p>

<p>The main feature of this project is the <strong>interactive map</strong> [link], which users can use as an entry point to the Sacred Spaces directory [link], which contains information about different temples and locations established in the region since the arrival of Europeans in the sixteenth century and prior to the process of independence in the early-eighteenth century. Using different primary and secondary sources, we are locating in space and time all the religious temples, missions, <em>encomiendas</em>, towns, cities, and villages built between the late-sixteenth and the early-eighteenth centuries. Each of the markers in the map provides background information the place. Some of these markers will allow users to access pages of detailed information from each of the temples in the map.</p>

<p>Access our resource [link] page for bibliographical information about Venezuela’s religious history. We have also created a documents [link] section in which you can learn transcriptions of primary sources!</p>

<p>We hope this website can be a valuable educational tool about religious practices, the history of architecture, and the geography of the region!</p>
