Pub Note	1st edition, 1st state. King George II copy. Howes P481; Sabin 64140; Schwartz & Ehrenberg 151; Winsor V, p82. The first state of the large map and the index map (see Cumming & Wallis for Margary reprint and Cumming 216) in that the pages are unnumbered, no credits below the neat line on sheet 17 or the title sheet, and Toms & Seale on Sheet 20. The binding is full red morocco with gold tooling at the edges and the coat of arms of King George II in gold on the front and back covers; the spine is stamped with "Popple's Atlas" in gilt. This copy was sold to the family I acquired it from by Francis Edwards in 1929/30 - a copy of Edward's 1929 catalogue entry is tipped into the front of the book. Tooley, Mapping America p 316, says "A copy (of the Popple Map) bound in red morocco for George II sold in 1930..." Lacks the contents sheets and the half sheet #4 (provided in expert facsimile). The index map is in full color while the map sheets are uncolored. The first large scale map of America and the most accurate at the time. Covens and Mortier published a six sheet edition in 1740 (Lowery). Lowery, Howes and Phillips incorrectly list Seale as "Searle." Howes mentions a later edition by Jefferys, but I can find no record of it.
